# Research
**Our research focuses on the following four aspects:**
- Personalization, Recommender System, Online Advertising, Search Engine, and Information Retrieval
  - The Recommender Systems, Online Advertising, and Search Engines are three interrelated components in Information Retrieval that help users find the information and content they need among a vast amount of data. Recommender Systems provide personalized recommendations based on user behavior, preferences, and historical interactions. Online Advertising leverages user data to deliver relevant advertisements to individuals. Search Engines, such as Google and Baidu, use algorithms to index and rank webpages based on relevance and quality, helping users find the information they are looking for. Together, these three components work to improve the overall search experience for users and make it more efficient. The integration of machine learning techniques, deep learning, and big data analytics into these systems has made it possible to deliver highly accurate recommendations and advertisements in real-time, while providing a more engaging search experience. The use of these technologies has been shown to increase user satisfaction and revenue for businesses, making them critical components of modern information systems.
